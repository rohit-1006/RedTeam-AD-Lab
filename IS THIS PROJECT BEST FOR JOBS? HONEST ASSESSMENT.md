```

### **Worst Case Scenario:**

```
IF AFTER 2 MONTHS YOU HAVE NO OFFERS:

LIKELY REASONS:
1. Resume not passing ATS (applicant tracking systems)
   FIX: Use Word format, remove graphics, add keywords

2. Not applying to enough jobs
   FIX: Apply to 50+ jobs, not 20

3. Poor interview performance
   FIX: Practice with mock interviews (Pramp.com is free)

4. Location issues (few jobs in your area)
   FIX: Apply to 100% remote positions

5. Salary expectations too high
   FIX: Be flexible on first job, focus on getting foot in door

ACTION PLAN:
- Expand search radius (remote jobs)
- Add certification (eJPT - $200, 2 weeks study)
- Record demo video and add to resume
- Apply to MSPs/consulting firms (always hiring)
- Consider contract/temp-to-hire roles

REVISED TIMELINE: 3-4 months to first offer
```

## **9. Companies That LOVE Projects Like Yours**

### **Tier 1: High Probability (60-80% interview rate)**

```
COMPANY TYPE: Security Consultancies (SMBs)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Examples:
- Local/regional pentesting firms
- MSSPs (Managed Security Service Providers)
- Boutique security consultancies

Why They'll Hire You:
✅ Need junior talent (high turnover)
✅ Value hands-on skills over degrees
✅ Client work requires report writing (you demonstrated this)
✅ AD pentesting is 50% of their engagements

Salary: $60k-$80k
Application Strategy: Direct email to founder/CTO
```

### **Tier 2: Medium Probability (30-50% interview rate)**

```
COMPANY TYPE: Mid-Size Tech Companies (500-5000 employees)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Examples:
- SaaS companies building security teams
- FinTech companies (compliance-driven)
- HealthTech (HIPAA requirements)

Why They'll Consider You:
✅ Building security programs from scratch
✅ Need generalists who can wear multiple hats
✅ Budget for entry-level but want proven skills
✅ AD security is a pain point (your specialty)

Salary: $70k-$90k
Application Strategy: Apply + LinkedIn message to hiring manager
```

### **Tier 3: Low Probability (10-20% interview rate)**

```
COMPANY TYPE: FAANG / Top Tier Security Firms
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Examples:
- Google, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft
- CrowdStrike, Mandiant, Palo Alto Networks
- Big 4 consulting (Deloitte, PwC, etc.)

Why It's Harder:
❌ Hundreds of applicants per position
❌ Prefer candidates from target schools
❌ Often require specific certifications (OSCP, GPEN)
❌ Multi-round technical assessments

But Not Impossible:
✅ Your project could get you past HR screen
✅ Referrals are key (network on LinkedIn)
✅ Apply anyway - you miss 100% of shots you don't take

Salary: $90k-$120k (entry-level at these companies)
Application Strategy: Get referral, then apply

## **14. FINAL ANSWER**

# **YES, THIS PROJECT IS EXCELLENT FOR GETTING JOBS.**

**Here's why I'm confident:**

1. **You have proof of skill** (99% of candidates don't)
2. **You demonstrated both offense and defense** (rare combination)
3. **You can hold a technical conversation** (project gives you stories)
4. **You show initiative and self-direction** (employers value this highly)
5. **You have a portfolio link to share** (differentiates you immediately)

**BUT REMEMBER:**

The project **opens the door**.

**YOU** have to walk through it.

That means:

- ✅ Applying to 50+ jobs
- ✅ Practicing interview answers
- ✅ Networking on LinkedIn
- ✅ Being persistent through rejections
- ✅ Continuously improving your skills

---

## **MY PREDICTION FOR YOU:**

**If you:**

- Practice interview answers
- Network actively

**Then:**

- 80% chance of job offer within 3 months
- Starting salary: $65k-$85k
- Role: Junior Pentester, Security Analyst, or AD Specialist

**If you don't:**
